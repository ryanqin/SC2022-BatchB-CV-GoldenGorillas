{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"0bffc9","input":"# Let's Build An AI Face Detector!\n\nIn just a couple, simple lines you will be able to build your very own face detector where you can input a image url and the face detector will draw boxes around the faces before displaying the results of **AI face detection.**\n\n### Theory Behind the Model\nFirst the face detector splits the image into multiple small sections. For each section, it first runs a series of general facial tests. The sections that pass these tests move on to the next, more specific, facial tests and the ones that don't pass are disregarded. On the sections that the face detector is unsure about, it runs more and more tests (a total of 6000) until the face detector can be positive that the section is part of a face. It is like a cascade, or waterfall, of tests which is why the face detector we use is called a cascade classifier.","metadata":{"id":"npPdoLfV6RlL"},"pos":0,"type":"cell"}

{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"1bef2d","input":"### Detect the Faces\n\nWe execute the detectMultiScale method to detect the faces. \n\n* The first input is the **grayscale image** we want to use for detection. \n\n* **scaleFactor** is used if the image is too large and we make it smaller by a factor of 1.1 as the face detector can only detect faces in a certain range of sizes.\n \n* **minNeighbors** is one of the most important parameters in the model. Remember, the image is first split into many small sections before classification. If minNeighbors is 5, there must be 5 other parts, or sections, of a face around a certain section if that section can be classified as part of a face (because usually one part of the face is surrounded by other parts). If you make minNeighbors larger, than the model will be much more sure about the faces it detects but it might miss some faces. If you make this smaller, the model will detect more faces but it will also make more mistakes. \n\n* **minSize** is the minimum size a face must be in order for it to be viable for detection.  \n\nThe method will output the coordinates of all the faces found.\n\n","metadata":{"id":"FcClRtog9Fpf"},"pos":11,"type":"cell"}
